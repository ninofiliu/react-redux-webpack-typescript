# React + Redux + Webpack + TypeScript : Building a front-end from scratch

[`create-react-app`][create-react-app] and [`ng new`][angular cli] are useful tools to quickly create a client application, but they hide an awful lot of actions that are valuable to know about from a developer point of view. Building an application from an empty folder is slower but every line in the source code is fully understood by the developer, and that is **a huge plus**.

In this article, we're going to build a React/Redux app in TypeScript that is built with Webpack, keeping things as simple as possible in every step of the way. The finished code can be found on [this github repo][github].

## Step 1 : NPM, Webpack and Babel

Let's start with the core of the project. Move to the folder project and create these files:

* `./package.json`, file content: `{}`
* `./src/index.tsx`, file content: `console.log('Hello from index.ts');`
* `./src/index.html`, file content below

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>
            Hello from index.html
        </p>
    </body>
</html>
```

The goal for now is to:

1. transform the source code (only composed of `index.tsx` for now) into into some JS that can be handled by the browser
2. Make `index.html` include this JS
3. Serve `index.html`

[Webpack][webpack] and [Babel][babel] are two tools that can be combined to do that: Babel will transform `.tsx` files into `.js` files that can be understood by Webpack, and Webpack will bundle all the source code into a code that can be served by a server and handled by a browser. Create a `./webpack.config.js` file that contains the following:

```js
// packages imports
const HtmlWebpackPLugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
    mode: 'development',
    
    // webpack will begin its module resolution there...
    entry: './src/index.tsx',

    // ...and outputs it to ./dist/bundle.js
    output: {
        path: `${__dirname}/dist`,
        filename: 'bundle.js'
    },

    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                // for all files in the source code that ends by .ts or .tsx...
                test: /\.(ts|tsx)$/,
                exclude: /node_modules/,
                // ...transform it in JS thanks to Babel (more below)
                loader: 'babel-loader'
            }
        ]
    },

    resolve: {
        extensions: ['.ts', '.tsx']
    },
    plugins: [
        // copy ./src/index.html to ./dist/index.html and adds a script tag referencing ./dist/bundle.js
        new HtmlWebpackPLugin({template: './src/index.html'})
    ],
    devServer: {
        // the dev server will serve the content of ./dist (more below)
        contentBase: './dist'
    }
}
```

We're also going to need the following `./babelrc` file:

```json
{
    "presets": [
        "@babel/preset-env",
        "@babel/preset-react",
        "@babel/preset-typescript"
    ],
}
```

To oversimplify a bit, this tells Babel to:

1. Transform `.tsx` into `.jsx` (`@babel/preset-typescript`)
2. Transform `.jsx` into `.js` (`@babel/preset-react`)
3. Transform the remaining `.js` to make it understandable by browsers (`@babel/preset-env`)

We also need to add `./tsconfig.json` so as to insctruct Babel how to handle typescript:

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "allowJs": true,
        "jsx": "react"
    },
    "include": ["./src"]
}
```

We can now launch two useful commands:

* `webpack`: build the whole project into `./dist`
* `webpack-dev-server --open`: like `webpack`, but serves the content of `./dist` and reload upon code change

Let's add them to the script entry of `package.json`, which now must look like:

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "build": "webpack",
        "start": "webpack-dev-server --open"
    }
}
```

Finally, install required dependencies:

```bash
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin webpack-cli
npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react @babel/preset-typescript babel-loader
```

If everything is working, your app should have the following behavior:

```bash
npm run build
    # creates ./dist/bundle.js, with the code of ./src/index.tsx at the bottom
    # creates ./dist/index.html: similar to ./src/index.html, but a script referencing bundle.js has been added

npm run start
    # builds the project into an in-memory ./dist folder (ie you can't navigate to it)
    # opens your default browser
    # 'Hello from index.html' is being displayed in the page
    # 'Hello from index.tsx' is being displayed in the console
```

**Congratulations! You just done the first step of this tutorial! Reward yourself with some cola or something.**

## Step 2: React and TypeScript

### The components

React is pretty cool. But you know what's cooler? The Vostok Station in Antartica ([-89Â°C recorded in July 1983][vostok]). Enough with bad jokes - let's make React cooler by writing it in TypeScript.

First, install React and ReactDOM with their type declarations: React is written is JS, but installing [declaration files][declaration files] allows to type React:

```bash
npm install --save react react-dom
npm install --save-dev @types/react @types/react-dom
```

Now let's build the application. It's going to be an *extremely simple* one consisting of two components:

* `display`: displays '(name) is (age) years old'
* `edit`: inputs to change the name and the age

For now we'll pass everything as static props, but we'll link the two via a redux store later on.

Let's write the display component in `components/display.tsx`:

```js
import * as React from 'react';

export default class Display extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <p>
                {this.props.name} is {this.props.age} years old.
            </p>
        )
    }
}
```

Oh no! We have errors:

```
[TS2339] property 'name' does not exist on type 'Readonly<{children?: ReactNode}> & ReadOnly<{}>'
[TS2339] property 'age' does not exist on type 'Readonly<{children?: ReactNode}> & ReadOnly<{}>'
```

This is because, as of now, `Display.props` is inherited from `React.Component` and its only valid property is `children`. Let's change `React.Component` to `React.Component<{ name: string, age: number}>`. This instructs `Display.props` to have additional `name` and `age` properties. Error gone!

Let's build the edit component having that in mind. We can define additional state properties just like we can define additional props properties. In `./src/components/edit.tsx`:

```js
import * as React from 'react';

type EditProps = {
    setName: (name: string) => void,
    setAge: (age: number) => void
}
type EditState = {
    name: string,
    age: number
}
export default class Edit extends React.Component<EditProps, EditState> {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            name: 'James Foobar',
            age: 25
        }
    }
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <p>
                    <input
                        value={this.state.name}
                        onChange={evt => this.setState({name: evt.target.value})}
                    />
                    <button onClick={() => this.props.setName(this.state.name)}>
                        Set new name
                    </button>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <input
                        value={this.state.age}
                        onChange={evt => this.setState({age: +evt.target.value})}
                    />
                    <button onClick={() => this.props.setAge(this.state.age)}>
                        Set new age
                    </button>
                </p>
            </div>
        )
    }
}
```

Finally, we wrap them up in an app component. Note that components written as functions can also be typed as show below. In `./src/components/app.tsx`:

```js
import * as React from 'react';

import Display from './display';
import Edit from './edit';

export default (props: {}) => (
    <div>
        <Display
            name={'John Doe'}
            age={20}
        />
        <Edit
            setName={name => alert(`setName(${name}): not coded yet`)}
            setAge={age => alert(`setAge(${age}): not coded yet`)}
        />
    </div>
)
```

### Bootstrapping the app

This is a basic operation when creating a React app, but it also gets abstracted by `react-create-app`.

Change `./src/index.html` so that the body looks like: `<body><div id="react-root"></div></body>`. This will allow React to bootstrap from the `#react-root` element.

Change `./src/index.tsx` to the following:

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import App from './components/app';

ReactDOM.render(
    (<App/>),
    document.querySelector('#react-root')
);
```

**Annnnnd we're good to go! Launch `npm run start` and play around with the app you created. We still don't have a redux store to link the components together, but the components should work by themselves now.**

## Step 3 : Redux and TypeScript

```bash
npm install --save redux react-redux
npm install --save @types/react-redux
```

Honestly, it gets quite trickier from here and it won't be as simple as adding typings at the end of abstract classes like in step 2. But it's the price to pay for a beautiful scalable typed redux store. Let's create these files:

```
./src/store/index.ts
./src/store/types.ts
./src/store/age.reducer.ts
./src/store/name.reducer.ts
```

*Putting the age and the name would have been a great option in production, but I'm creating two reducers so as to demonstrate how to combine reducers because the typing considerations on this point are not as easy as they seem.*

Note that this is not the only way to type a store. There is no official recommendation on how to proceed and it's basically up to each developer to find the best way. The way I'm going to present here is based on research I've done, personal work, and also personal taste - I love to [KISS][kiss].

Firstly, let's populate `./src/store/types.ts` with the shared types of objects we're going to use in other parts of the store:

```ts
type Action<TType, TPayload> = {
    type: TType,
    payload: TPayload
};
type Reducer<TState, TAction> = (state: TState, action: TAction) => TState;

export { Action, Reducer }
```

Now, let's build the reducers, starting with the age reducer:

```ts
import { Action, Reducer } from './types';

// internal reducer state
type State = { value: number }

// all the possible action cases: only one here, but there can be more
enum ActionCases { SET_VALUE = 'age/SET_VALUE' }

// initial reducer state
const stateInit: State = { value: 20 }

// action creator that can be dispatched
type SetValueAction = Action<ActionCases.SET_VALUE, {value: number}>;
const setValue
    : (value: number) => SetValueAction
    = (value) => ({
        type: ActionCases.SET_VALUE,
        payload: { value }
    });

// all the possible actions: only one here, but there can be more:
// type Actions = ActionType1 | ActionType2 | ...
type Actions = SetValueAction;

const reducer
    : Reducer<State, Actions>
    = (state=stateInit, action) => {
        switch(action.type) {
            case ActionCases.SET_VALUE:
                return {value: action.payload.value};
            default:
                return state;
        }
    };

export { reducer, setValue, State, Actions }
```

The name reducer will be almost the same - simply replace the `number` type by `string`, the initial state value by `John Doe`, and the `age/` by `name/`.

Now, wrap all the reducers into a single store (in `./src/store/index.ts`):

```ts
import { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux';

import * as age from './age.reducer';
import * as name from './name.reducer';

// store state
type State = {
    age: age.State,
    name: name.State
}

// all the possible actions that can be dispatched
type Actions = age.Actions | name.Actions;

// redux takes charge of the typing from now on (see below)
const store = createStore<State, Actions, {}, {}>(
    combineReducers<State>({
        age: age.reducer,
        name: name.reducer
    })
);

export { State, Actions, store }
```

**Great, you created a typed store! There is not much you can see for now though.**

# Step 4 (grand finale) : Connecting React to the store

A wonderful store is indeed useless if you're not using it. Let's use the `react-redux` to connect components with the store. For example, the Display components is rewritten as such:

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';

import { State } from '../store';

class Display extends React.Component<{ name: string, age: number}> {
    render() {
        return (
            <p>
                {this.props.name} is {this.props.age} years old.
            </p>
        )
    }
}

const mapStateToProps = (state: State) => ({
    age: state.age.value,
    name: state.name.value
});

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(Display);
```

The same thing is done with the Edit component:

```js
// add imports
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { store } from '../store';
import { setValue as setAge } from '../store/age.reducer';
import { setValue as setName } from '../store/name.reducer';

// ...

// connect the component
const mapStateToProps = null;
const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch: typeof store.dispatch) => ({
    setName: (name: string) => dispatch(setName(name)),
    setAge: (age: number) => dispatch(setAge(age))
});
export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Edit);
```

The App component is rewritten so that inputs are coming from the store and not from the App component:

```js
export default () => (
    <div>
        <Display/>
        <Edit/>
    </div>
)
```

Finally, the store is provided to the app in `./src/index.tsx`:

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'; // add this

import App from './components/app';
import { store } from './store'; // add this

ReactDOM.render(
    // (<App/>) remove this
    (<Provider store={store}><App/></Provider>), // add this
    document.querySelector('#react-root')
);
```

**You're done.** You should observe this behavior when running `npm run start`:

* Typing into the input fields change the input value â the state of the edit component works
* Clicking on `Set new name` or `Set new age` changes the value of the sentence in the Display component â your store is connected to both components

**This is the end. Bravo, you did it! You built a beautiful front-end from scratch. You're now a senior web developer. Go get a $60K/year job!**
