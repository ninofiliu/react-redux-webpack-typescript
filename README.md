# React + Redux + Webpack + TypeScript : Building a front-end from scratch

[`create-react-app`][1] and [`ng new`][2] are useful tools to quickly create a client application, but they hide an awful lot of actions that are valuable to know about from a developer point of view. Building an application from an empty folder is slower but every line in the source code is fully understood by the developer, and that is *a huge plus*.

In this article, we're going to build a React/Redux app in TypeScript that is built with Webpack, keeping things as simple as possible in every step of the way. The finished code can be found on [this github repo][3].
